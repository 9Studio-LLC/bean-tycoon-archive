# I want to help.
Great! Here's what you need to know...
# I want to update the game.
You can, but any pull requests, issues, etc. will be ignored for the AIA file.
# I want to document the game.
We are currently not interested in documenting the game, as we will leave it for contributors such as you!
# I want to use your license.
You are fully allowed to use 9License, though we recommend you read it 1st if you haven't already.
# Why are releases, packages and deployments disabled?
We don't really need these for what this repo is for. If you want to find the APK, [here it is](https://missingpro.itch.io/bean-tycoon)!  

That's all you need to know. Thanks for reading this!
